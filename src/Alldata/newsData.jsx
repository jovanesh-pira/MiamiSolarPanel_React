      "Miami Solar introduced its latest Helios 450W Mono PERC module with higher efficiency and better temperature performance.",
    content: `
Miami Solar has officially launched the new Helios 450W high-efficiency module for commercial and industrial rooftop systems.

The Helios 450W uses advanced Mono PERC cell technology and an optimized busbar design to reduce internal resistance and power losses. With a module efficiency of up to 22.6%, the new design ensures higher power output under diverse climate conditions, including hot summers and cold winters.

The module is certified to IEC standards, provides improved load resistance, and comes with a 25-year linear power warranty, making it an excellent choice for long-term solar investments.

For partners and EPC contractors, Helios 450W will be available in standard and bifacial versions starting Q2 2025.
